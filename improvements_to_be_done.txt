The prompts that are given must be changed for all the 3 agents that can handle the understanding
of the Register number attribute in the results database.
Currently, the sql_query_generator is generating the query with respect to the register number 
with capital letter in the regnumber ie, 22SEAD53. But the prompt must be changed to generate the query
so that the sql query is generated as 22sead53 as per the database.
